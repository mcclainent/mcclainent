I would like to build a module that works with odoo.com.  I need it have coupons instead of products. The coupns should count up everytime some picks
tthat coupn. Coupons ahould be uploaded by merchants using their backend to track data. Ther merchant should be able to designate the coupon to automatically
increase in discount the more people claim that coupun.
